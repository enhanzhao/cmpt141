test_func_between##################################

Input: 50, 1, 100
Output: True
Reason: Test for when num1 is between num2(low end) and num3(high end)

Input: 50, 100, 1
Output: True
Reason: Test when num1 is in between num2(high end) and num3 (low end)

Input: 100, 1, 50
Output: False
Reason: Test when num1 is greater than num2 and num3 thus not in between num2 and num3

Input: -50, -1, -100
Output: True
Reason: num1 is negative and inbetween num2 and num3, which are also negative intergers

Input: 0, 0, 0
Output: False
Reason: Test for when all 3 numbers are zeros, thus num1 is not in between num2 and num3

Input: 0, -1, 1
Output: True
Reason: Test for when num1 is in between num2 and num3, when one is negative and one is positive

test_func_majority3#############################################

Input: [1, 1, 0, 3, -3]
Output: True
Reason: Test for zeros, positive, and negative numbers. If one does not work then ouput will be False

Input: []
Output: False
Reason: Test the for loop in function when there is an empty sequence

Input: [111111111111111111111111111111, 111111111111111111111, 111111111111111, 111111111111, 111111, 1, 1, 1]
Output: True
Reason: Test when 5 large numbers divisible by 3 are more than 50% of sequence

Input: [-111111111111111111111111111111, -111111111111111111111, -111111111111111, -111111111111, -111111, -1, -1, -1]
Output: True
Reason: Test when 5 small numbers divisible by 3 are more than 50% of the sequence

Input: [2, 4, 5, 3, 3, 3]
Output: False
Reason: Test for when exatly half the items in the sequence are divisible by 3

Input: [3]
Output: True 
Reason: Test for a single item in the sequence divisible by 3
