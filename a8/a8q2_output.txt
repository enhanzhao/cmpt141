Error: Returned None on inputs [0, 0, 0] (should return True as there are 3 zeros in sequence and their sum is zero)
Error: Returned None on inputs [0, 0, 1] (should return False, as there is no way for a sum of 0)
Error: Returned None on inputs [0, 0] (even though sequence sum is zero, it only contains 2 items)
Error: Returned None on inputs [0, 1] (sum is not zero, and sequence only contain 2 items)
Error: Returned False on inputs [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (should return True if function iterates over the first item)
Error: Returned False on inputs [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (should return True if function iterates over the last item)
Error: Returned None on inputs [] (should return False with empty sequence)
Error: Returned False on inputs [0, 0, 0, 10, 10] (test for when the intergers need for sum 0 is in the beginning, the middle and the end of the sequence)
Error: Returned False on inputs [-4, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3] (test for first second and third are at least one item away from each other)
Error: Returned None on inputs [-5, 0, 2, 3] (test for when first is at least one item away from second and third)
Error: Returned False on inputs [-11, -10, 0, 1, 20, 21] (test for when third is at least one item away from first and second)





The function does not account for situations where the list it takes contains less than three items.
Instead of returning None, there should be code in the beginning that return False when givien a short list:
ex: if len(in_list) < 3:
	return False
       
The indices are not initialized properly. 
first should start on in_list[0], not in_list[1]. Therefore the for loop should have -2, not -3
third should start on in_list[len(in_list)-1] or in_list[-1], not in_list[-2]. 
As a result of these errors, the first and last item of the sequence is not covered in the iteration. 

In the assignment PDF the last line returns (False) however in the starter file, it doesnt. Either way,
the last line should read: return False
